# =============================================================================
# MODE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Starting in SEEDING mode because:
# - Citadel is an evolving dashboard (Phase 1 ~70% complete)
# - New component patterns are still being established
# - Need flexibility to add journey, cost, and git diff components
#
# Transition to GROWTH mode when:
# - Phase 2 components (journey, cost, git) are established
# - Component patterns stabilize
# - Reuse patterns emerge
